We are on a mission to make the process of buying and selling easier and more convenient - and with your help, it will be possible. But before we work together, we would like to assess your programming abilities.

Please find the small assignment below, that we would like for you to complete in the allotted time. (If you are reading this, the clock is already ticking).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
  yarn run start
```

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```bash
  yarn run build
```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
