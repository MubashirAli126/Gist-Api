## Gist Api

- In this project, I have created a gist project.
- I used React Icons, Bootstrap, and styled components.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
  npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```bash
  npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.
